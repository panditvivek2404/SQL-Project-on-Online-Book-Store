# SQL-Project-on-Online-Book-Store

 This project demonstrates the design and querying of a simple Online Book Store Database using SQL Server.
 The database is built using three CSV files:

 Customers.csv → Contains customer details.
 Books.csv → Contains book information such as title, author, genre, and price.
 Orders.csv → Contains order details linking customers with purchased book

 The project covers both basic and advanced SQL queries to showcase database handling, data analysis, and reporting skills.
